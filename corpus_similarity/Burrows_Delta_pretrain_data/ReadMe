This Burrow's Delta is based the z-score standardization on top N words frequency. 

For an input document(or corpus), f_i is the frequency of word(i); mean_i is the mean of f_i in a number of background documents (corpora) of the same language; std_i is the standard deviation of f_i. Then z_i(input) is the z-score standardization value for f_i in the input document.     

z_i(input) = ( f_i - mean_i ) / std_i



Mean_i and std_i are pre-trained and stored in json files based on backgound corpora for each language. Pre-training is conducted using 200 sub-corpora (50000 words size each) divided from background corpus for each language. Top 5K wordlist (offered in this package) is applied.  

Format of the stored values:

{ word_i: [mean_i, std_i], 
  word_j: [mean_j, std_j],
  .

}


Cosine similarity (Cosine Delta) can be calculated based on z-scores.
